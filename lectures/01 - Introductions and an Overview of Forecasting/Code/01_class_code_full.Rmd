# R Setup and Required Packages

In this course, the open-source R programming language is used. R is maintained by an international team of developers who make the language available at [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/).  I recommend the [Hands-on Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/packages.html) for a brief overview of the software's functionality. 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

<!-- Chunk names need to be unique or you will get an error -->

```{r packages}
# Checking to see whether the pacman package is installed
if(require(pacman) == FALSE) install.packages("pacman") # if pacman is not on your machine, install it

pacman::p_load(tidyverse, # tidyverse -- IMO you will need it for most of your data analysis
               tidyquant, # to be used for getting stock data
               magrittr,  # we are loading to use the pipe operators
               DT) # for printing the tables nicely
```

# Grammar of Graphics
The grammar of graphics is a **framework** which follows a **layered approach** to describe and construct visualizations or graphics in a **structured manner**. It was introduced by [Leland Wilkinson](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-28695-0) and has inspired the development of the [ggplot2 package](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) in R. In this course, we will often use the `ggplot2::ggplot()` to create graphs. 

> ''ggplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics. You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details''

```{r ggplotWebFigures, echo=FALSE, out.width="48%", fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("https://www.ericchowkokyew.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2.png",
                          "https://englelab.gatech.edu/useRguide/images/dataviz/ge_all.png"))
``` 

## FANG Example

```{r fang}
# tq_get is from the tidyquant package
FANG = tq_get(x = c('AMZN', 'FB', 'GOOG', 'NFLX'), # the stocks that we want to get
              from = '2020-01-01', # gets this date or the next trading date
              to = '2021-01-24') # get data up to BUT NOT including that date
str(FANG) # returns the internal structure of that object

FANG %>% # layer 1: data (which gets passed as the first argument to the next function via the pipe (magrittr))
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = date, y = adjusted, group = symbol)) + # layer 2: aesthetics
  geom_line() + # layer 3:
  facet_wrap(~ symbol, ncol = 2, scales = 'free_y') + # layer 4: facets (optional)
  stat_smooth(method = 'loess') + # layer 5: optional (here we are fitting a local regression to data)
  labs(x= 'Date', y = 'Adjusted Closing Price', 
       caption = 'Data from 2020-01-02 to 2021-01-22') +
  theme_bw()

# getting the starting date
FANG %>% 
  filter(date == '2020-01-02') %>%  # filter function comes from dplyr (tidyverse) and is a rowwise operation
  select(symbol, adjusted)  -> # select is a column wise operation (dplyr)
  baseFANG

# getting the ending date
FANG %>% 
  filter(date == '2021-01-22') %>%  # filter function comes from dplyr (tidyverse) and is a rowwise operation
  select(symbol, adjusted)  -> # select is a column wise operation (dplyr)
  currentFANG

combinedFANG = left_join(x = baseFANG,
                         y = currentFANG,
                         by = 'symbol') # also comes from dplyr/ tidyverse  
colnames(combinedFANG)[2:3] = c('base', 'current')   

combinedFANG$pctChange = 100* (combinedFANG$current - combinedFANG$base)/ combinedFANG$base

datatable(combinedFANG,
              extensions = c('FixedColumns', 'Buttons'), 
              options = list(
                dom = 'Bfrtip',
                scrollX = TRUE,
                buttons = c('copy', 'csv', 'excel', 'pdf'),
                fixedColumns = list(leftColumns = 1)) ) %>% 
              formatRound(columns= c('base', 'current', 'pctChange'),
              digits=2)
```


# Things to Do

  - Before next class, you are highly encouraged to attempt to complete the activity presented in Slide 23 of the notes.  
  - We have covered everything that is needed for the [Graded Assignment](https://miamioh.instructure.com/courses/123532/quizzes/317526), which is due January 28, 2021 at Midnight. **So please feel free to complete it before class or by the deadline**.
