  Demonstrate your knowledge of the materials covered in class so far. This tutorial is meant to supplement the in-class lectures, graded/non-graded assignments, and everything we have done in class so far. It should also serve as an interactive study guide that can help you evaluate your understanding/knowledge of the material covered so far in class.

## Welcome 

In this self-paced guide, you will review: (a) forecasting and time-series data definitions, and (b) the use of R to extract data (through both the `read.csv()` and `tq_get()` functions). This review is optional, but if you plan on completing it, you are advised to do the following prior to attempting the tutorial.   

1. Read Chapter 01 from our textbook.  
2. Have completed the [in-class examples in the lecture notes for Week 01](https://miamioh.instructure.com/courses/142177/modules).  
3. Be able to dedicate about 20-40 minutes to go through this entire tutorial.

## Review

Based on [our textbook](https://www.wessexlearning.org/pobf2e/index.html), a **forecast** *is a prediction or estimate of an actual outcome expected in a future time period or for another situation.*   
  - *The purpose of forecasting is to inform the process of planning.*  
  - *The purpose of planning is to develop a course of action so that things don't “just continue” based on a no-change forecast.*


One of the important concepts from Week 01 was to distinguish between the terms: (a) cross-sectional data, (b) time-series data, and (c) panel data. Let us examine your understanding of these three terms.

```{r cross-sectional, echo=FALSE}
question("Based on the concepts learned in class, you would classify the Fantasy Football Projections for QBs at: https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/projections/qb.php as",
  answer("Cross-sectional data",  correct = TRUE),
  answer("Time-series data", message = "It is not a time series since the data is aggregated for the entire 2020 season."),
  answer("Panel data", message = "Panel data involves several cross sectional measurements repeated over time. This answer is incorrect since we only have one time period here (the 2020 NFL season in its entirty)"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```


In the R chunk below, please read the data from [Grunfeld's Investment Dataset](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/wgreene/Econometrics/grunfeld.csv), store the data in a data.frame titled `grunfeld`, and print the data.frame. **Note that you can use a csv link as an input to the** `read.csv()` (i.e., just copy the link address and input it to the function). 
```{r exercise1, exercise=TRUE, excercise.eval= TRUE}

```

```{r exercise1-solution}
grunfeld = read.csv("http://people.stern.nyu.edu/wgreene/Econometrics/grunfeld.csv")
grunfeld
```

```{r panel, echo=FALSE}
question("By inspecting the rows (note the multiple pages) from the printed object above, grunfeld represents",
  answer("Cross-sectional data",  message = "We do not define this as cross sectional given that the data is collected repeatedly over time."),
  answer("Time-series data", message = "It captures 10 firms, where their investments (I), real value (F) and stocks' value (C) are provided. Thus, it should be considered as a panel dataset since it combines features of both cross sectional data and time series data."),
  answer("Panel data", correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

Please extract the following series `PRENEL01CNQ656N` from FRED into R. This can be done using the [tidyquant package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyquant/tidyquant.pdf):  

  - The first argument in `tq_get()` is the time series of interest.
  - Using the command `?tq_get()` see how to change the get argument to capture data from FRED.  
  - You will also need to change the starting date to `1999-01-01`.

After following the above instructions, please recreate the graph below. 

![Total Electricity Production for China](images/elecChina.png)
```{r exercise2, exercise=TRUE, excercise.eval= TRUE}


```

```{r exercise2-hint-1}
tepc = tq_get('PRENEL01CNQ656N', get = 'economic.data', from = '1999-01-01')
```

```{r exercise2-hint-2}
cat("Note that my figure contains two different geometries (points and lines).")
```


```{r exercise2-solution}
tepc = tq_get('PRENEL01CNQ656N', get = 'economic.data', from = '1999-01-01')

tepc %>% ggplot(aes(x= date, y = price)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Total electricity production for China", y = "Gigawatt Hours", x = "Date", 
       caption = "Data from FRED") + theme_bw()
```

```{r tsplotInterpret, echo=FALSE}
question("From the graph above, we can describe this dataset as: [Select all that apply]",
  answer("Seasonal", correct = TRUE),
  answer("One with increasing trend", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Cyclical", message = "The trend is consistent so it is seasonal and not cyclical."),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```
