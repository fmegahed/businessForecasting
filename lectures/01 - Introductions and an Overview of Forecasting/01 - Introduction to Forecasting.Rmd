# So What is Forecasting?

### When I Searched for Forecast on the Web
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \href{https://tinyurl.com/yyktgqz2}{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth, height = 0.75\textheight, frame, keepaspectratio]{Figures/forecast.png}}
  \caption{People tend to link forecasting to the "weather" (at least that is what search engines think).}
\end{figure}

### Definition -- from Bing

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \href{https://tinyurl.com/y5h5k4aj}{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth, height = 0.75\textheight, frame, keepaspectratio]{Figures/forecastDef.png}}
  \caption{The definition of the term "forecast" as obtained from Bing/Merriam-Webster.}
\end{figure}


### Definition and Purpose

**Forecast** *is a prediction or estimate of an actual outcome expected in a future time period or for another situation.*\footnotemark

- *The purpose of forecasting is to inform the process of planning.*  

- *The purpose of planning is to develop a course of action so that things don't “just continue” based on a no-change forecast.*


\footnotetext{The definition and purpose provided in this slide are from: Ord, K., Fildes, R., \& Kourentzes, N. (2017). Principles of Business Forecasting (2nd ed., p. 3). Wessex Press Inc.}


### Working Definitions -- From Prof. Jones-Farmer

\begin{block}{\textbf{Forecasting}}
\textbf{The process of predicting a future event. The objective of most time series analyses is to \textcolor{miamired}{provide forecasts of future values of the time series.}}
\end{block}

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\begin{block}{\textbf{Time Series}}
A \textbf{\textcolor{miamired}{time series}} is a sequence of observations on a variable measured at successive points in time or over successive periods of time. In the simplest cases, observations are evenly spaced at regular intervals such as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly, or at any other regular interval.\footnotemark
\end{block}

\footnotetext{Both definitions are based on \href{https://miamioh.edu/fsb/directory/?up=/directory/farmerl2}{Dr. Allison Jones-Farmer's} lecture notes, Miami University, Spring 2020.}


### The FAANG (- AAPL) Time Series Data - an R Exercise [1]

\textcolor{miamired}{Let us get and generate the time series below.} **I promised this class will be fun!!!**

\vspace{-0.5\baselineskip} 

```{r timeseries, echo=FALSE, fig.fullwidth = TRUE}
if(require(pacman)==FALSE) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(tidyquant, tidyverse, scales)
FANG = tq_get(c('FB', 'AMZN', 'NFLX', 'GOOG'),
              from = "2020-01-01")
FANG %>% ggplot(aes(x = date, y = adjusted, group = symbol)) + 
  facet_wrap(~symbol, ncol = 2, scale = 'free_y') + 
  geom_line() + scale_x_date(breaks = pretty_breaks(n=4)) +
  labs(y = "Adjusted Closing Price", x = "Date") +
  theme_bw()
```

\vspace{-1.25\baselineskip} 

\centering{\textcolor{darkgreen}{COVID-19 did not have any long-lasting effects on Tech stocks.}}


### The FAANG (- AAPL) Time Series Data - an R Exercise [2]

We can actually quantify my statement in \textcolor{darkgreen}{green} from the previous slide by computing the 
percent change in each of the four stock prices when compared to January 2, 2020. \textcolor{miamired}{This can be done as follows: (see live coding session in class).\footnotemark}
```{r pctChanges, echo=FALSE}
if(require(pacman)==FALSE) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(tidyquant, tidyverse)
FANG %>% filter(date == '2020-01-02') %>% select(symbol, adjusted) -> baseFANG
FANG %>% filter(date == '2021-01-22') %>% select(symbol, adjusted) -> currentFANG
colnames(baseFANG)[2] = 'base'
colnames(currentFANG)[2] = 'current'
combinedFANG = merge(baseFANG, currentFANG, by ="symbol") %>% 
  mutate( pctChange = 100*(current - base)/base )
cat(paste0('The percent changes (from January 2, 2020) in the AMZN, FB, GOOG and NFLX',
    '\n', ' stocks are: ', round(combinedFANG[1,4],1), '%, ', 
    round(combinedFANG[2,4],1), '%, ', round(combinedFANG[3,4],1), '%, and ', 
    round(combinedFANG[4,4],1), '%, respectively.'))
```

\footnotetext{The printed numbers from my computations had a current date of January 21, 2021. Thus, the numbers will change (slightly) unless we use the same ending date for our calculations.}


### In-Class Activity

Based on the previous exercise, use the [COVID-19 package](https://covid19datahub.io/articles/api/r.html) to plot the confirmed COVID-19 cases for the states of Ohio and Kentucky. You should create two plots: (a) plot containing both of the states as two seperate lines in a line plot, and (b) a paneled plot similar to the output depicted in Slide 21.

**Hints:**  

  (1) Once you have installed the package inspect the `covid19` function using the command `?covid19()`.  
  (2) Set the country argument to the US.   
  (3) Use an apporpriate value for the level argument based on `?covid19()`.  
  (4) Set the starting date to '2020-03-01'
  (5) Filter the obtained data to only include data for the two states.


### Why do we Forecast? -- A Conceptual Framework (PIVASE)\footnotemark

- **Purpose:** What do we hope to achieve by generating the forecast? That is, what plans are dependent upon the results of the forecasting exercise? How far ahead do we wish to forecast? We refer to this period as the forecasting horizon.  

- **Information:** What do we know that may help us in forecasting. And when will we know it? Detailed data is only useful if it is available in timely fashion.   

- **Value:** How valuable is the forecast? What would you pay for perfect knowledge?   

- **Analysis:** From analyzing the data can we develop a model that captures its characteristics? And how does it perform on new (hold-out sample) data?   

- **System:** What models and software are needed to meet the needs of the organization?  

- **Evaluation:** How do we know whether a particular forecasting exercise was effective and what the potential is for improvement?
