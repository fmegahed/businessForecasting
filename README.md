# businessForecasting
 This repository contains my lecture notes (PDFs generated from R Markdown) for our business forecasting class. The course is an introductory course on forecasting and time series analysis. 
 
 ## Ackonwledgments
* The organization of the course is based on the Spring 2020 class taught by [Dr. Allison Jones-Farmer](https://miamioh.edu/fsb/directory/?up=/directory/farmerl2). I am extremely thankful that she was willing to share her course materials with me. I have learned a lot from how she set up her course and for her vision for this undergraduate course.  
* In our course, we are using the [Principles of Business Forecasting Book by Ord, Fildes & Kourentzes](https://wessexlearning.com/products/principles-of-business-forecasting-2nd-ed). Therefore, the structure of my lecture notes closely follows the material in the book (but in many cases with updated examples and additional details based on my research and/or the excellent material created by Dr. Jones-Farmer). 
 
 ## Notes
 * I did my best to add references whenver possible. If I missed a reference, please let me know.
 * If you have identified mistakes/typos, please let me know. Teaching a course in the midst of a pandemic, with your university's decision to increase number of course preps, is interesting.
